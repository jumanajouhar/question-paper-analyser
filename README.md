# question-paper-analyser

Problem Statement:
The academic journey for students is often fraught with stress, particularly during exam periods where they face the daunting task of preparing for assessments. One significant source of stress arises from the uncertainty surrounding exam content, leading students to spend considerable time and effort on studying a vast array of topics, often without a clear understanding of which areas are most important.

Solution:
Develop a question paper analyzer application to assist students in identifying key questions from uploaded question papers, alleviating stress and facilitating more focused study sessions, especially during crunch times. This tool aims to provide accessible support for students, ensuring they can better prepare for exams and improve their academic performance, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being and success.
